          We know that IKEA is the largest furniture company in the world. This
          company has lots of products making people easy to use and build on
          their own in some product but why their app is hard to use and
          difficult to understand that's why I redesign the IKEA app to make the
          app easy and useful for people

            People who use the IKEA app have a better chance to figure out
            what's in my design therefore they can use it easier before it was!
            this redesign include creating a new flow and design for users to
            search for items by word by word or by filtering and adding the
            selecting item in the cart saved in your heart list so users get
            easier to use and make them happier

              When I observed IKEA version 3.9.1 app where i feel less
              intraction and users can't be understand how to use. So i noted a
              few points that could solve the problem in this app so that people
              can interact with this Application more peacefully and not to
              frustrated while using this app

                The users review in Google Play store totally went negative
                people who uses IKEA app tends to handle difficult to use the
                app and hard to search any item in it.Therfore we the UX
                designer needs to evaluate the current user interface to find
                out the problem that amke it difficult for users to serach
                items,lets find the solution to the problems by creating a new
                user interface that makes it easier for users.

              I created user personas from 5 interviewed users after running

              User personas are needed to descirbe potential users based on the
              research that has been done. The user persona that I’ve created
              describes user profile and personal Background, User Environment,
              Pyschographics, end goals and scenario of using the application,
              user behavior using the application, frustration when using the
              application.

            <p>
              Users can't understand what is in the home screen the picture in
              the home screen is so big and it is difficult to navigated where
              to go? The steps that the users must take are not simple because
              the home screen should be as accessible as possible for the users
              to understand.
            </p>

            <h6>Solution:</h6>
            <p>
              Instead of covering half of the screen we can use slider in the
              home screen so that users can understand even better and navigate
              easily and can see rest of the products. its user interface is not
              good

            <p>
              The many problems rise in the home screen section in that home
              screen there is no product detail, rating, price, etc all was the
              only picture and lots of pictures like gallery
            </p>

            <h6>Solution:</h6>
            <p>
              The solution for my design is to separate all the products with a
              small card and with sliders add some product images and detail to
              it.

            <h6 class="py-2">Problem:</h6>
            <p>
              The card size and the item price are too large in the item details
              the add to cart button is not properly fixed it looks unbalanced
              because on-screen looks full and the information must be beautiful
              neatly aligned
            </p>

            <h6>Solution:</h6>
            <p>
              Change the item image size and item price font to a smaller size
              than before to create a more balanced design. The solution can
              also make more information and people can buy easier than before
              the position of the cart button has been changed and added trash
              button and quantity for the product in the cart section at the
              bottom section you can see how much product added in the cart
              section and the amount you need to pay then checkout

              scenario. this test is carried out using Figma prototype and
              useberry and users are aked to run the prototype according to the
              task on their device. This test also wanted to see how the user’s
              expectations of the new design that I created, and find out
              whether the solution I implemented had addressed all the pain
              points that users felt in the first test of the current IKEA
              application.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Overall, users have a nice experience after trying out the new
              design prototype. The new design makes homescreen better and
              efficient and easier to use.Smoother to use because of the
              pleasant UI design in the design and placement of profile,add to
              cart,home,and my favourite are in the navigation menu Easier to
              use because users find it helpfull to have a search filed in each
              product menu.Finally users feel visually and functionlly happy by
              adding different set of design in cart page and my favourite page
              informative and creative which in this new design adds a you can
              instanstensly remove from favourite page by clicking the icon and
              same as in cart page just clicking the trash icon
